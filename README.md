# ts3-backup
This script is for making backups of your TS3 server to mega.nz storage. For you is the file ts_backupEN.sh.. (one with CZ on the end is in Czech language). Script was made for Debian 8 64-bit and it was not tested on any other OS.

You can edit my script as you want, but please. Do not remove / edit wget and cat commands for getting actoual notifications and credits, thanks.

If you want to contact me, contact places are in the script.
